ExpOse Tool Challenges Report:
Getting the expose tool to work was a heck of a struggle initially trying to run the command java edu.allegheny.expose.examples.sort.SortingExperiment bubble --verbose 
in the expose terminal resulted in the error:

Error: Could not find or load main class edu.allegheny.expose.examples.sort.SortingExperiment

So i instead attempted to run the command in the bin terminal which gave me this error:

Error:: command not found
beltg@aldenv107:~/cs112F2016/cs112F2016-Gabriella Belt/labs/lab6/cs112f2016-lab06/ExpOse/bin$ java edu.allegheny.expose.examples.sort.SortingExperiment bubble --verbose

At this point i was at a bit of a loss so i decided to slack you, you suggested i return to the website
and redo every step doing that produced this exception and error:

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 0
	at edu.allegheny.expose.examples.sort.SortingExperimentRepeated.main(SortingExperimentRepeated.java:19)


Error: Could not find or load main class edu.allegheny.expose.examples.sort.SortingExperimentRepeated

So i decided to ask my classmates what they did and they suggested i reclone ExpOse and use that one to run my 
experiments rather that the file i had pushed to bitbucket; doing that produced this error yet again:

Error: Could not find or load main class edu.allegheny.expose.examples.sort.SortingExperimentRepeated

By this point i had become very frustrated so i focused on writing up a full report on what each sorting 
program did and what the expected worst-case was based on other scholar's work which i cited in my report.
Once i finished with that i decided to look for a TA, there was no TA to be found though so then i paniced 
for a half hour and went for a walk. Once returning i looked over the book to see if i missed something, that 
was not helpful...
However it finally worked on my partner's computer rather than mine, TEAMWORK YAY!
