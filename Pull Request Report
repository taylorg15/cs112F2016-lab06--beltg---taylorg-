Pull Request Challenges Report:
Well after googling how to make a pull request in
BitBucket i figured it would be easy to make one
and then BitBucket went down for maintenance making upload
impossible and making a pull request just silly. In other words
my biggest challenge was waiting for BitBucket to finish maintenance. Not 
to mention my trouble actually running ExpOse (see expose report)
